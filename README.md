## Features

<img  src="assets/images/mockup.png"  alt="Geats App">

### 1. Nutritional Analysis

Geats analyze nutrition accurately and quickly. Users can easily access real-time information about calories, nutrients, and other nutritional aspects of the food they consume.

### 2. Food Comparison

The application includes a food comparison feature, allowing users to compare the nutritional content of two or more types of food. This empowers users to make healthier food choices with a powerful tool at their disposal.

### 3. Personalized Diet Planning

Geats can plan users' daily diets with personalization in mind. Considering individual preferences, allergies, and nutritional needs, the app provides food recommendations to help users achieve their health goals.

### 4. Food Redistribution and Rewards

An innovative feature involves the redirection of leftover food. Users who donate their excess food to food banks receive reward coins as a form of incentive. These coins can be exchanged for various benefits, creating a positive incentive for users to participate in food sustainability efforts.

### 5. Waste Utilization

Geats encourages users to repurpose their food waste by turning it into compost, food for maggots, or food that can be consumed again.

### 6. Health Education Platform

The app is not just an information provider; it also functions as a health education platform. Informative articles, webinars, and other multimedia content help enhance users' understanding of the importance of health and the impact of food on the body.
